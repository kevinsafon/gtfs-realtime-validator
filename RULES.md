# Warnings

<a name="W001"/>

### W001 - `timestamp` not populated

`timestamps` should be populated for `FeedHeader`, `TripUpdates`, `VehiclePositions`, and `Alerts`

<a name="W002"/>

### W002 - `vehicle_id` not populated

`vehicle_id` should be populated for TripUpdates and VehiclePositions

<a name="W003"/>

### W003 - `VehiclePosition` and `TripUpdate` feed mismatch

If both vehicle positions and trip updates are provided, `VehicleDescriptor` or `TripDescriptor` values should match between the two feeds

<a name="W004"/>

### W004 - VehiclePosition has unrealistic speed

`vehicle.position.speed` has an unrealistic speed that may be incorrect

<a name="W005"/>

### W005 - Missing `vehicle_id` in `trip_update` for frequency-based exact_times = 0

Frequency-based exact_times = 0 trip_updates should contain `vehicle_id`.  This helps disambiguate predictions in situations where more than one vehicle is running the same trip instance simultaneously.

<a name="W006"/>

### W006 - `trip_update` missing `trip_id`

`trip_updates` should include a `trip_id`.  A missing `trip_id` is usually an error in the feed (especially for frequency-based `exact_times` = 0 trips - see [E006](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-realtime-validator/blob/master/RULES.md#E006), although the section on "Alternative trip matching" includes one exception:

>Trips which are not frequency based may also be uniquely identified by a TripDescriptor including the combination of:
>
> * `route_id`
> * `direction_id`
> * `start_time`
> * `start_date`
>
> ...where `start_time` is the scheduled start time as defined in the static schedule, as long as the combination of ids provided resolves to a unique trip.

See:
* [`trip_update.trip`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#alternative-trip-matching)

<a name="W007"/>

### W007 - Refresh interval is more than 35 seconds

GTFS-realtime feeds should be refreshed at least every 30 seconds.

<a name="W008"/>

### W008 - Header timestamp is older than 65 seconds

The data in a GTFS-realtime feed should always be less than one minute old.

# Errors

<a name="E001"/>

### E001 - Not in POSIX time

All times and timestamps must be in POSIX time (i.e., number of **seconds** since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC).

See:
* [`header.timestamp`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-feedheader)
* [`trip_update.timestamp`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripupdate)
* [`vehicle_postion.timestamp`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-vehicleposition)
* [`stop_time_update.arrival/departure.time`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-stoptimeevent)
* [`alert.active_period.start` and `alert.active_period.end`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-timerange)

*Common mistakes* - Accidentally using Java's `System.currentTimeMillis()`, which is the number of **milliseconds** since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC.  

*Possible solution* - Use `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toSeconds(System.currentTimeMillis())` to convert from milliseconds to seconds.

<a name="E002"/>

### E002 - Unsorted `stop_sequence`

`stop_time_updates` for a given `trip_id` must be sorted by increasing stop_sequence (this should always be enforced whether or not the feed contains the stop_sequence field). A TripUpdate can have multiple stop_time_updates (e.g., one prediction per stop) - so, this shouldn't be monitored across multiple feed messages, just in a single message.

<a name="E003"/>

### E003 - GTFS-rt `trip_id` does not exist in GTFS data

All `trip_ids` provided in the GTFS-rt feed must exist in the GTFS data, unless their `schedule_relationship` is set to `ADDED`.

<a name="E004"/>

### E004 - GTFS-rt `route_id` does not exist in GTFS data

All `route_ids` provided in the GTFS-rt feed must exist in the GTFS data

<a name="E006"/>

### E006 - Missing required trip field for frequency-based exact_times = 0

Frequency-based `exact_times` = 0 `trip_updates` must contain `trip_id`, `start_time`, and `start_date`.

See:
* [`trip_update.trip`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#systems-with-repeated-trip_ids)

<a name="E010"/>

### E010 - `location_type` not `0` in stops.txt

(Note that this is implemented but not executed because it's specific to GTFS - see #126)

If location_type is used in `stops.txt`, all stops referenced in `stop_times.txt` must have `location_type` of `0`

<a name="E011"/>

### E011 - GTFS-rt `stop_id` does not exist in GTFS data

All `stop_ids` referenced in GTFS-rt feeds must exist in the GTFS data in `stops.txt`

<a name="E012"/>

### E012 - Header `timestamp` should be greater than or equal to all other timestamps

No timestamps for individual entities (TripUpdate, VehiclePosition, Alerts) in the feeds should be greater than the header timestamp.

<a name="E013"/>

### E013 - Frequency type 0 trip `schedule_relationship` should be `UNSCHEDULED` or empty

For frequency-based exact_times=0 trips, schedule_relationship should be `UNSCHEDULED` or empty.

<a name="E015"/>

### E015 - All `stop_ids` referenced in GTFS-rt feeds must have the `location_type` = 0

All `stop_ids` referenced in GTFS-rt feeds must have the `location_type` = 0 in GTFS `stops.txt`

<a name="E016"/>

### E016 - `trip_ids` with `schedule_relationship` `ADDED` must not be in GTFS data

Trips that have a `schedule_relationship` of `ADDED` must not be included in the GTFS data

<a name="E017"/>

### E017 - GTFS-rt content changed but has the same header `timestamp`

The GTFS-rt header `timestamp` value should always change if the feed contents change - the feed contents must not change without updating the header `timestamp`.

See:
* [`header.timestamp`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-feedheader)

*Common mistakes* - If there are multiple instances of GTFS-realtime feed behind a load balancer, each instance may be pulling information from the real-time data source and publishing it to consumers slightly out of sync.  If a GTFS-rt consumer makes two back-to-back requests, and each request is served by a different GTFS-rt feed instance, the same feed contents could potentially be returned to the consumer with different timestamps. 

*Possible solution* - Configure the load balancer for "sticky routes", so that the consumer always receives the GTFS-rt feed contents from the same GTFS-rt instance. 

<a name="E018"/>

### E018 - GTFS-rt header `timestamp` decreased between two sequential iterations

The GTFS-rt header `timestamp` should be monotonically increasing -  it should always be the same value or greater than previous feed iterations if the feed contents are different.

See:
* [`header.timestamp`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-feedheader)

*Common mistakes* - If there are multiple instances of GTFS-realtime feed behind a load balancer, each instance may be pulling information from the real-time data source and publishing it to consumers slightly out of sync.  If a GTFS-rt consumer makes two back-to-back requests, and each request is served by a different GTFS-rt feed instance, the same feed contents could potentially be returned to the consumer with the most recent feed response having a timestamp that is less than the previous feed response.

*Possible solution* - Configure the load balancer for "sticky routes", so that the GTFS-rt consumer always receives the GTFS-rt feed contents from the same GTFS-rt instance.

<a name="E019"/>

### E019 - GTFS-rt frequency type 1 trip `start_time` must be a multiple of GTFS data `start_time`

For frequency-based trips defined in `frequencies.txt` with `exact_times` = 1, the GTFS-rt trip `start_time` must be some multiple (including zero) of `headway_secs` later than the `start_time` in file `frequencies.txt` for the corresponding time period.  Note that this doesn't not apply to frequency-based trips defined in `frequencies.txt` with `exact_times` = 0.

<a name="E020"/>

### E020 - Invalid `start_time` format

`start_time` must be in the format `25:15:35`.  Note that times can exceed 24 hrs if service goes into the next service day.

See:
* [trip.start_Time](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripdescriptor)

<a name="E021"/>

### E021 - Invalid `start_date` format

`start_date` must be in the `YYYYMMDD` format.

See:
* [trip.start_date](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripdescriptor)

<a name="E022"/>

### E022 - trip `stop_time_update` times are not increasing

Sequential `stop_time_update` arrival/departure times should increase - they should never be the same or decrease between two sequential stops.  Within the same `stop_time_update`, arrival and departures times can be the same, or the departure time can be later than the arrival time - the departure time should never come before the arrival time.

<a name="E023"/>

### E023 - `start_time` does not match GTFS initial `arrival_time`

For normal scheduled trips (i.e., not defined in `frequencies.txt`), the GTFS-realtime trip `start_time` must match the initial `arrival_time` in `stop_times.txt` for this trip.
